## About
mkd is a bare-bones, online Markdown editor that enables peer-to-peer sharing of the documents you write. Documents are stored locally in the browser thanks to `localStorage`. Sharing is achieved via WebRTC.

**Note** that no TURN server is configured so sharing works only if a direct connection between peers can be established. ðŸ˜ž
